It is the location where you type your   \r\ncode and it can be both on or off line. It can be considered the local file.\r\n    \r\n###Examples of Git would be:\r\n\r\n* _cloud9_\r\n* _Nitrious_\r\n\r\nGithub is a website on the cloud. You can put code into it and take it out   \r\nand others can access it easily.\r\n\r\nTo use Git and Github, you would have to type your code in git then commit  \r\nyour work and push it into the github. You can also pull or make copies of   \r\nit (cloning) if you need to later on. It is called the remote.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\nBefore you pull or push code into and out of Github, Github must know where the  \r\ncode and coming from. So you must connect your coding platform with Github in  \r\nthe cloud.\r\n\r\n###Steps for Initial setup:\r\n1. make a Github account\r\n2. find the SSH key of the Git and us to connect to the github\r\n3. copy and paste the SSH key into the github (it can start with ssh-rsa)\r\n4. Then you will need to connect your username and yoru email to github though  \r\ngit.\r\n5. So you use _git config_ for your remote (cloud) to understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\nSetting up a Repository will let you push things into github. A Repository is  \r\na local file where you can type your code.\r\n\r\nYou can work on a file and connect it to Github.  \r\n\r\nIn order to connect it to the github you must initialize, **save**, add, commit and \r\npush:  \r\n\r\ninitialize:\r\n\r\n    Git init <inside of repository>\r\n    \r\nsave:  \r\n\r\n    command/control S \r\n\r\nadd:\r\n\r\n    git add <name of file>\r\n    \r\ncommit:\r\n\r\n    git commit -m <\"any name that work for coder\">\r\n    \r\nStatus (if you need):\r\n\r\n    Git status (tells you the situation)\r\n    \r\nPush:\r\n\r\n    Git push \r\n\r\nThen if you check the Github page that you comected the repository to, you will  \r\nsee the changes that you have made.\r\n\r\ngit: a basic command that recognizes git  \r\nremote: this is the connection to the file that can be altered in github  \r\nadd: a remote repo will be added\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n\r\nWhen typing work, it can get messy. SO you need to format the page to make it  \r\nmore readable:\r\n\r\nItalics:\r\n\r\n    _text_\r\n    \r\nbold:\r\n\r\n    **text**\r\n    \r\nlargest header:\r\n\r\n    # text\r\n\r\nsmaller headers:\r\n\r\n    ##text\r\n    ###text\r\n    ####text\r\n    \r\nadd picture or link:\r\n\r\n    [text](URL)\r\n    \r\nbullets:\r\n\r\n    * text\r\n    * text\r\n\r\nordered list:\r\n\r\n    1. text\r\n    2. text\r\n    3. text\r\n    \r\nline break:\r\n\r\n    text(then two spaces)\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more help please visit Mr. Mueller's slides:  \r\n[Click here for slides](https://sites.google.com/a/hstat.org/11sep1516/github) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
